# Mini Projects in PyTorch
------------------------------
These are some PyTorch projects created by the team that will allow you to showcase your skills and see the use cases of PyTorch in real-life projects.

## MNIST Project:
The first project focuses on the MNIST problem. In this project, we developed a Neural Network model with 2 hidden layers to classify handwritten digits. We utilized the MNIST dataset and the DataLoader provided by PyTorch, allowing us to efficiently batch our data and train the model. This approach ensures that our model is trained effectively on the large dataset, with optimized performance due to the batching process.

## IRIS Project:
This project focuses on classifying iris flower species using a Neural Network model developed in PyTorch. The model is built with 2 hidden layers and utilizes the Iris dataset to learn patterns and  classify the three different species of iris flowers. This project demonstrates the application of a neural network to a classic multiclass classification problem.
