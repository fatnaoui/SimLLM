## Self-Attention
-------------------
The Self-Attention Mechanism is a pivotal innovation in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing how models process and understand sequences of data. This mechanism allows models to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data, effectively capturing dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence. It has become a cornerstone in many advanced AI systems, particularly in natural language processing.

We are offering comprehensive guides to deepen your understanding:
